project-number: 03.
project-type: tablet app (ux + ui)

summary: In 2019, the healthcare innovation team ‘Health Kite’ received a $50,000 grant for the development of a digital platform for the education, engagement and monitoring of 2000+ Victorian domiciliary oxygen therapy patients of the State-Wide Equipment Program (SWEP).

challenge-title: the challenge
the-challenge: As an innovative based piece, the scope of the project was vague and consistently morphed throughout the design process to fulfill our overarching goals. Our challenge was to constuct a platform that provided domiciliary oxygen therapy patients with various tools and resources that
c-point1: encouraged and empowered patients to better self-manage their condition
c-point2: educated patients on how to better manage their condition
c-point3: better connected oxygen therapy recipients with Supagas to optimise their equipment ordering and maintenance experience

specs-title: the specs
specs: At the outset of the project exisiting key deliverables had been set, however, through extensive secondary research, user interviews, and Stakeholder meetings these were consistently amended to include
s-point1: a Patient Recorded Outcome Measure (PROM) survey
s-point2: the ability to capture physiological data through pulse oximetry readings 
s-point3: the ability to order consumables from Supagas 
s-point4: educational content (text and video)
s-point5: and troubleshooting materials

research-title: research
research1: With the deliverables set, I sought to uncover how these would fit within a patients daily life. So, from here, I visited a small number of domiciliary oxygen therapy patients within Melbourne at the homes to conduct one-on-one interviews. To uncover more about their conditions and how they manage them, I prompted them with questions such as "Tell me about how your condition affects you on a daily basis?" and "How well do you feel you understand your condition?".

research2: User interviews revealed potential participants limited technological knowledge, fear of technology, and concern that the proposed device would be purposeful. Based on these insights, in order to optimise the application we needed to inspire confidence in the user. Our key design challenges became
r2-point1: ensuring consistent device use
r2-point2: creating an approachable and easy to use application
r3-point3: overcoming the error in human recording

research3: From here, I used these findings to create service blueprints to illustrate the touchpoints between the user, tablet application, backend systems, and Supagas. 

ideation-prototype-title: ideation + prototyping
prototyping: Due to the simplistic nature of the design, wireframes were produced in a rapid manner and were presented to Supagas at regular intervals. Specific elements were chosen to
p-point1: ensure there were only 1 - 2 necessary taps per page
p-point2: to provide users with feedback throughout all tasks

interface-title: the visuals
interface: As the predominant age demographic of oxygen therapy patients ranged from 65 - 84,  specific visual choices were made that included
interface-point1: warm, high contrasting colours to minimise desaturation
interface-point2: small, manageable chunks of text 
interface-point3: icons supplementing text to increase comprehension 

success-metrics-title: success metrics
success-metrics: Due to COVID-19, the deployment of tablets to patients homes for a 3 month trial was post-poned, as was a secondary round of user testing afterwards. I have not been updated on the status of this project since.

lessons-learnt-title: what i learnt 
lessons-learnt: With a challanging user for the project, I learnt a lot about accessible design and the varying needs of a nicher demographic. However, going back I feel I would've reworked my colour and font choices to something ever simpler. I've adopted a much stronger minimalistic approach to design that would make this design more suitable for the demographic.
