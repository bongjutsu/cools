project-number: 04.
project-type: desktop app + mobile web app (ux + ui)

summary: Canberra Sleep Clinic struggled to engage with exisiting patients and attract new ones. We developed a scalable digital engagement tool that combined the management and retention of current patients, and the ability to interact with prospective ones.

challenge-title: the challenge
the-challenge: The clinic's existing platform was outdated and offered limited opportunites to engage with patients. My challenge was to constuct an ecosystem comprising of two components - a mobile web application and administrator portal - that
c-point1: made it easier for healthcare professionals to better connect and engage with patients
c-point2: allowed professionals to proactively approach patient management
c-point3: improved operational efficiency to attain competitive advantage in the market

research-title: research
research1: I started by conducting a two day workshop with a small focus group of Stakeholders and their key users in Canberra to gather insights into the clinic's current methods of patient retention and attraction. I undertook user interviews wand tackled affinity mapping to further define their key users and to dictate current and future workflows.

specs-title: the specs
specs: From this inital meeting, we set out a list of key deliverables
s-point1: a desktop application that captured and reported on Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and Patient Reported Experience Measures (PREMs) as a method of patient engagement
s-point2: a desktop application that provided insights into patient health outcomes, the effectiveness of the care provided, and the overall patient experience
s-point3: a mobile web application that implemented a QR based survey for prospective patients
s-point4: an additional mobile web application that delivered Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and Patient Reported Experience Measures (PREMs) to exisiting patients


research2: With the deliverables set, I created service blueprints to illustrate the touchpoints between the other applications they clinic would be using, the eCaptis platform, and patients mobiles. 

ideation-prototype-title: ideation + prototyping
prototyping: As the project was proposed to be built off our existing proposal 'Modulus,' I was able to quickly produce and iterate concepts. This enabled me to produce hi-fidelty wireframes in a rapid pace as the client was largely satisifed with our exisiting proposal. Over the course of a month, I presented the client with multiple presentations over zoom to finely tweak features.

interface-title: the visuals
interface: Specific visual choices were made that included
interface-point1: limiting branding colours to sidebar, headings, icons, and buttons, to ensure the interface can be easily adopted by other businesses
interface-point2: plentiful use of white space was used to ensure content would be quickly and easily visible at a glance
interface-point3: alerts that were coloured throughout to distinguish high priority patients
interface-point4: a structured yet approachable typeface was picked so content could be easily scanned, and to depict an approachable demeanour

success-metrics-title: success metrics
success-metrics: eCaptis has since been successfully deployed at Canberra Sleep Clinic. Future implemention within other clinics and hospitals is pending; as if the development of additional features such as
s-point1: ability to swtich between languages
s-point2: additional reporting tools

lessons-learnt-title: what i learnt 
lessons-learnt: Throughout this project, I learnt the complexities when creating an application that had the ability to send and recieve data from other applications. It was interesting to learn about the workflow of the clinic as it opened my eyes to a new area of health. Looking back I wouldn't change anything in the design as I feel I have created an interface that can be easily adopted by other clinics and hospitals.
