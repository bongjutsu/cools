project-number: 01.
project-type: desktop + tablet app (ux + ui)

summary-number: 1/8
summary: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cabrini Technology Group commissioned the design and development of a medical hospital-grade UVC disinfection system. We established Bluewave, a 'no touch' system revolutionising the future of environmental disinfection.

challenge-title: the challenge
the-challenge: COVID-19 triggered unforseen events across the globe, and with it came a new wave of diligence and respect to maintaining hygiene in health and aged care facilities. Our challenge was to use mobile UV-light technology to construct an environmental disinfection system that
c-point1: reduces the spread of multi-drug resistant bacterial infections
c-point2: is remotely controlled through a tablet-based application
c-point3: is managed through a portal that covers room-by-room disinfection history and individual system usage

research-title: research
research1: Due to working remotely, a strong emphasis was placed on secondary research from experts in the area. Research was broken up into market, technical and user research with members of staff from Cabrini Health regarding their current practices. Empathy mapping and user personas assisted me in deducing that the design needed to be
r1-point1: intuitive and simple to account for users with low levels of English and/or technological capabilities â€” if the design was too complex, the user will refuse to use it
r1-point2: bold and clear to ensure the safety of users and those outside of the room being disinfected

research2: I used these findings to create a service blueprint to illustrate the touchpoints between the user, tablet application, Bluewave device, and web portal. This included
r2-point1: remotely setting and managing Bluewave disinfection cycles based on the room size and bacteria type via the tablet application
r2-point2: providing visual and audio feedback of cycles in progress, cycle interruptions, and completed cycles
r3-point3: a portal that displayed the status of all disinfected rooms that could be narrowed down into detailed summaries for reporting

ideation-prototype-title: ideation + prototyping
prototyping: As this project had a tight turnaround time, concepts were developed and iterated upon in a rapid manner. Over the course of three weeks, my designs morphed from basic wireframes to high fidelity prototypes in Figma based on consistent stakeholder and engineer feedback.

interface-title: the visuals
interface: Specific visual choices were made that included
interface-point1: colours that were based off the logo provided and stakeholder desires; a deep blue was applied in order to ensure the branding was clear
interface-point2: warning, caution, and okay colours to clearly distinguish the urgency of required actions
interface-point3: a basic, large, serif typeface was used to ensure legibility at various distances

lessons-learnt-title: what I learnt
lessons-learnt1: As I completed the inital designs throughout the early months of covid we were unable to undertake user testing with the specified users. However, the overall process and screen design was consistently iterated upon with stakeholders, engineers and potential users to ensure it would be functional.
lessons-learnt2: Going back I would've pushed to conduct specific user testing with key users to ensure all my insights were accurate, rather than taking the word of engineers and stakeholders. However, this was a great learning experience into the complexities of creating a device from scratch and how multiple sources would interact with each other.
